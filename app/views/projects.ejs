              <p class="card-text">This assignment was a solo project assigned as the final task of my second 
                semester programming class. The topic of a GPA calculator was not the only option given, but it
                was the one that I chose. The goal was to create a WPF form on Visual Studio, which I already
                had never done before, and to create it using XAML, which was also something comepletely foreign
                to me. Despite so many things being new to me, this was still an incredibly enjoyable project that
                I had the opportunity to work on!

              <p class="card-text">This assignment was a semester long project assigned throughout my software
                engineering fundamentals course, and was definitely another new experience for me! The goal of 
                this assignment was to create an SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document, however,
                this assignment was to be completed in a group that you would collaborate with for the duration
                of the entire semester. I was required to have consistent communication between group members, in 
                a remotely taught course, to discuss plans and work, as well as consistently keeping up my end of
                the workload. On top of weekly reports that we had to prepare and present, several types of graphs,
                charts, and terminologies were required that needed to be learnt. This all culminated in a final 
                report at the end of the semester that landed my group a great grade after the work we put in 
                throughout the semester. This was definitely another very new experience that was challenging in 
                a different way compared to other programming related projects, but a very practical one indeed.

              <p class="card-text">Assigned in my second semester client-side web development class was my most
                unique project yet. The goal was to use html, css, and javascript to create a Whack-A-Mole esque
                game on a webpage. It required the user of event handlers , rendering functions, etc. that were
                new to me at the time. This all culminated in the making of an assignment that I was very proud of
                and was what got me intrigued with game development.</p>
